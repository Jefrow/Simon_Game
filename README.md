# Simon_Game

This is a game I made while learing Java Script and jquery through the London App Brewery Boot Camp. 
Please feel free to play the game and let me know what you think I'm open to any critiques and suggestion or a combination of both. 

How to play the game: 
Start the game by pressing any key. 
once started, you have to remember the whole sequence from the very beginning by clicking through every color.
